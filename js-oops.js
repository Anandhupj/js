// 1.key concepts of oops
// classes: templates for creating objects (instances).a class encapsulates data and function that operate on the data
// object:instances of class,object represent specific entities in your application with data and function
// inheritance : it allows one class to another use properties and methods from another class
// keeps data(properties) and methods together:encapsulation
// hide complex detailes and show only necessary part:abstraction
// polymorphism: allows object of  different class to the treated as object of a common super class
